This project has been enabled to run with IBM cloud developer CLI (https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloudnative/dev_cli.html#developercli).

To make full use of the files generated please note the following:

* Helm charts and Kubernetes deployment files have readiness probes defined that require a health endpoint and port
    * Expected port is 8080, default health endpoint is /health
    * Default health endpoint can be enabled by adding the Spring Boot actuator to your build file (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-actuator)
* Docker support files and IBM cloud deloyment files assume artifact locations based on Spring Boot defaults
    * Expected artifact location is target/sttcustomization-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
